## Information
JSON uses the filename extension ".json"  
The media type (MIME) is "application/json"  
It uses UTF-8 character encoding.  

### JSON Data Types
Number  
String  (zero or more Unicode chars, delimited with '"' and supports '\n' escape syntax)   
Boolean	(either 'true' or 'false)
Array	(ordererd list of zero or more elements. Uses '[' and ']' bracket notation with ',' separeted elements)  
Object	(A collection of name-value pairs or String_Key-Value pairs)  
null	(an empty value - not a pointer)

Whitespace is allowed and ignored around syntactic elements but not withing a string value.
Four specific characters are whitespace in JSON: Space:' ', Tab:'\t', LF:'\n', CR:'\r'.  
For UTF-8 and other, the Byte Order Mark (BOM) must not be generated by a conforming implementation. (U+FEFF = zero width no-break space)  
JSON does not have comments.  
JSON does not differentiate between numbers as integers or floating-point values (real).  (Thus '42', '42.0', '4.2E+1' can all be the same number, depending on the implementation)
