# Old HTTP Server in C

Can send html, css, js files  
Can send jpeg, png, svg files  
Can get basic REST request of PUT and GET tags  
Doesnt use JSON for that, its a custom bracket string  
  
It is not safe to use for any REAL website since it does not do any frontend/backend safety checking  

It requires SQLite3-dev to run and will run on localhost/8080  
The SQLite database is "ex1"
